I need you to build a comprehensive Settings page for my Sales SEO Audit Tool.

Please read the full specification in docs/SETTINGS-PAGE-PROMPT.md and use docs/SETTINGS-PAGE-CHECKLIST.md to track your progress.

Start by:
1. Reading both documentation files to understand the full scope
2. Creating a todo list to track all phases of development
3. Beginning with Phase 1: Database schema updates

Key requirements:
- Fully functional settings with database persistence
- Secure API key management (encrypted storage, masked display, test connections)
- Email notification preferences
- Report branding customization with live preview
- UI preferences (theme, view mode, items per page)
- Professional design matching our Rival Digital brand (navy & orange)
- Mobile responsive
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)

The implementation should follow our existing patterns:
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Follow the card styling from audit-card.tsx
- Use our design system in globals.css
- Follow API route patterns from /api/audits

Please work through the checklist systematically, marking items complete as you go. Let me know if you have any questions before starting!
