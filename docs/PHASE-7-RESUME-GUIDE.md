# Phase 7: How to Resume Work

**Quick guide for starting/resuming Phase 7 UX Transformation in any conversation**

---

## üöÄ Starting Fresh (New Conversation)

### Step 1: Share Context with AI
```
I'm working on Phase 7 of my Sales SEO Audit Tool - a professional UX transformation.
Please read these files to understand the plan:
1. docs/PHASE-7-UX-TRANSFORMATION.md
2. docs/PHASE-7-QUICK-CHECKLIST.md

The app is a Next.js 15 project with:
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components
- Rival Digital brand (Navy #002264 + Orange #f78d30)
- Clerk authentication
- Prisma + PostgreSQL

Current git status shows modified files in src/app and src/components.

Let's continue Phase 7 from where we left off.
```

### Step 2: Check Progress
Open `docs/PHASE-7-QUICK-CHECKLIST.md` and see which phases are checked off.

### Step 3: Start Next Phase
Tell the AI which phase to start:
```
Let's start Phase 7.1 - Navigation & Layout Architecture
```

## üìã Mid-Phase Resume

If you're in the middle of a phase:

```
I was working on Phase 7.2 (Dashboard Enhancements).

Completed so far:
- ‚úÖ stats-card.tsx
- ‚úÖ score-trend-chart.tsx
- ‚¨ú status-distribution-chart.tsx (next)

Let's continue with the status distribution chart component.
```

## üîç Quick Status Check

Ask the AI to check progress:
```
Please check docs/PHASE-7-QUICK-CHECKLIST.md and tell me:
1. Which phases are complete
2. What files have been created/modified
3. What's the next task
```

## üì¶ After Installing Dependencies

```
I've installed the dependencies:
npm install recharts @radix-ui/react-popover @radix-ui/react-separator

Now let's continue with Phase [X.X] - [Component Name]
```

## üêõ If You Hit an Error

I got this error when building/running:
[paste error]

Please help debug and fix.
```

## ‚úÖ Marking Progress
