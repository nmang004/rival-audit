## Usage Guide

### Setting Up Services (Optional)

All services are optional and work with fallbacks:

**1. SendGrid Email (Optional)**
```bash
# Get API key from SendGrid dashboard
# Add to .env.local:
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your-key-here"
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="audits@yourcompany.com"
PROJECT_MANAGER_EMAIL="pm@yourcompany.com"
WEB_TEAM_EMAIL="webteam@yourcompany.com"
```

**2. Slack Integration (Optional)**
```bash
# Create Slack App and get bot token
# Add bot to channel and get channel ID
# Add to .env.local:
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-your-token-here"
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID="C1234567890"
```

**3. App URL (Required for links)**
```bash
# Set app URL in .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://yourapp.com"    # Production
```

### Testing the Workflow

1. **Create a homepage audit** (e.g., `https://example.com`)
2. **Wait for audit to complete** (status changes to COMPLETED)
3. **Change status to SIGNED** using the dropdown
4. **Watch console logs** to see workflow execution:
   ```
   [Audit xxx] Status changed: COMPLETED → SIGNED
   [Audit xxx] Triggering signed workflow...
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Starting workflow execution...
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Homepage detected, fetching full SEMRush data...
   [SEMRush] Fetching comprehensive data for example.com...
   [Signed Workflow xxx] SEMRush data retrieved
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Generating Excel report...
   [Excel] Generated report with 50 keywords and 20 pages
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Uploading Excel to storage...
   [Storage] Excel file uploaded: xxx-SEMRush_Report.xlsx
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Generating strategic analysis with Claude...
   [Claude] Generated strategic analysis for signed client
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Sending email notification...
   [Email] Successfully sent to: [recipients]
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Sending Slack notification...
   [Slack] Successfully posted notification
   [Signed Workflow xxx] Workflow completed successfully
   ```

5. **Refresh audit detail page** to see success banner
6. **Download Excel report** from the button
7. **Check email inbox** (if configured) for notification
8. **Check Slack channel** (if configured) for notification

### Without API Keys

The system works perfectly without any API keys:
- **SEMRush**: Uses realistic placeholder data (50 keywords, 20 pages)
- **SendGrid**: Logs email content to console
- **Slack**: Logs message content to console
- All workflows complete successfully!

## Performance Considerations

- **Async Execution**: Workflow runs in background (no user waiting)
- **Quick Response**: API returns immediately after status update
- **Efficient SEMRush**: Parallel API calls where possible
- **Excel Generation**: Fast in-memory processing with ExcelJS
- **Claude Analysis**: Uses streaming for faster response
- **File Upload**: Local storage (instant), ready for S3
- **Error Recovery**: Partial failures don't block entire workflow

## Security Considerations

- ✅ All API keys stored as environment variables
- ✅ Never exposed to frontend/client
- ✅ File uploads sanitized for security
- ✅ Unique filenames prevent collisions
- ✅ User authorization checked before status changes
- ✅ Status change logging tracks all modifications
- ✅ Proper HTTPS for all external API calls

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Excel reports stored locally (not in cloud storage)
2. No email delivery confirmation tracking
3. No Slack message edit/update capability
4. Single email template (no customization)

### Planned for Phase 6
- Multi-URL report compilation
- PDF generation for combined reports
- Shareable report links with expiration
- Report management UI
- Email template customization
- S3/Vercel Blob storage integration

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering
- Check console for error messages
- Verify status changed from non-SIGNED to SIGNED
- Check that audit is a homepage (`isHomepage === true`)
- Look for workflow logs in console

### Email Not Sending
- Verify `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` is verified in SendGrid
- Look for email logs in console (fallback mode)
- Check recipient email addresses are valid

### Slack Not Posting
- Verify `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is valid
- Check `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` is correct
- Ensure bot is added to the channel
- Look for Slack logs in console (fallback mode)

### Excel Not Generating
- Check SEMRush data is available
- Look for Excel generation logs in console
- Verify ExcelJS package is installed
- Check file write permissions for uploads folder

## Next Steps - Phase 6

Ready to move to Phase 6: Multi-URL Reports
- Report creation UI
- Multi-audit selection
- Combined PDF generation
- Shareable report links
- Report management interface
